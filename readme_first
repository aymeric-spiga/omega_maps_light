a tool for OMEGA cartography
- visible images
- reflectance maps
- cloud detection


; ** installation
run the prep script : command line 'prep' or './prep'  
(NB : you will have to indicate your OMEGA files location)

; ** run
map parameters are in map_def (edit before running)
main idl routine is map.pro (in IDL command line simply type '.r map')


; ** to do list :
- include all the OMEGA visible spectels in the RGB computation
- allow to continue mapping (with modified parameters) without reloading cubes


; ** IMPORTANT
These routines helped the main scientific project i was working
on, but are not really part of it. So please be very indulgent, and 
consider you may find better routines elsewhere. 

- don't hesitate to ask help if problems appear while using the files
- any suggestion is welcome 
- let me know if you write any improvements to the routines
- please do not send the files to another person : ask him to contact me 

Have fun ! I would be glad if you find these files useful.


: ** NOTE
Thanks to the OMEGA team for the soft03.zip package
